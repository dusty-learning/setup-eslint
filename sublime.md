# Sublime

For those of you whom are using the sublime text editor here is how you're going to setup eslint

## Install Eslint Package

First things first we need to install the eslint package from npm. Using our handy dandy npm install command.

Here's what you're going to enter:

`npm i -g eslint`

**Side Note: Anyone using unix (mac or linux users) you may have to do `sudo npm i -g eslint` to install globally**

Few things to note: the `-g` here is VERY important. This tells npm that you want to globally install the eslint package to your machine.

But the good thing is now you have eslint installed, now we just need to setup sublime!

## Setting Up Sublime Text

So we need to use package control to install sublime linter. Remeber to open the "terminal" or input for this you have to use the `ctrl + shift + p` on windows/linux and `⌘ + ⇧ + P` on mac

Once that little input box opens start type `install`
