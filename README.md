# ESLint

Eslint is a tool that is extremely helpful in figuring out bugs, problems, and understand syntax with JavaScript.

So I want to take a second to help you get eslint installed and working in your vscode (or sublime) editor.

Just head into the corresponding folder to which editor you are using

Please don't hesitate to message me, or create an issue on this repo to ask a question!

By default eslint has built in sets of rules you can choose from, but you can also easily change and tweak each individual rule if you want!

You can find the huge list of rules here if you want to go through them: https://eslint.org/docs/rules/
